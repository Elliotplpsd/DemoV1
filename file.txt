last line was a lie, just like that cake i was promised. also heres the steps:
git init //initialize
git add .//add stuff to staging
git commit -m "comment"//commit the things that are in staging
git log//shows commits
git status//shows status(staged, unstaged,commited,uncommited)
git config user.name//changes username
git config user.email//changes email

git checkout branchname//jumps to selected branch
git branch//shows all branch names. the branch with the * is the one you're on
git branch newname//adds a new branch with the name
git branch -m newname//renames the branch you're in
